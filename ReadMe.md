## Redditron

#This app is in development



This is just a web app excersie for pulling reddit images/text from randomized redditboards (with nsfw options). A user can save and manager favorites, that are stored within local storage. The favorites have add/remove capability and within the reddit image feed, a user can search for a specific board and choose the tabs to filter through the content.



# To begin, you'll need to be sure to have Node and Electron installed globally.

# The root folder contains the `main.js` file to handle Electron, as well as it's `package.json` file to handle dependencies. Begin buy running `npm install` in root folder within your terminal. Next, change directors to `/client` and `npm install` there as well for the front end dependencies.


After you've installed the dependncies, you'll need to run both Electron and the server for the client.
You'll need to create a tab for each directory, the root of the repository, and `/client`.

In each tab run `npm start` for development.

Within client, running `npm run build` with build the front end.

Have fun, if you have an issue email pthibedeau@gmail.com
